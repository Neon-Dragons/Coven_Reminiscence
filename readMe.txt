SUMMARY:

In this world, powers are like social creatures. So for as long as powers have existed, so have people who can wield them. While playing Coven Reminisance, you play as a witch, Lilith, who wakes up in a forest full of mobs with no powers. The only thing she has is the silent hum of her powers whenever she's getting close to the Mourning Tree. An ancient tree that may be her only way out of the forest. She has nothing but her motivation, her slowly growing power, and a variation of mobs that she must navigate to return back to her coven. Can you survive the different mobs or will you die trying?
