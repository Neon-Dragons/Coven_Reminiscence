SUMMARY:

In this world, powers are like social creatures. So for as long as powers have existed, so have people who can wield them. While playing Coven Reminisance, you play as a witch, Lilith, who wakes up in a forest full of mobs with no powers. The only thing she has is the silent hum of her powers whenever she's getting close to the Mourning Tree. An ancient tree that may be her only way out of the forest. She has nothing but her motivation, her slowly growing power, and a variation of mobs that she must navigate to return back to her coven. Can you survive the different mobs or will you die trying?

INSTRUCTIONS: You begin the game in a box-like area of the map, you are surrounded by trees with no abilities other than to walk and move around. Upon turning the corner, you will hit a trigger point where you gain the ability to sneak. You press shift to sneak, and you are then introduced to the Caucus. The Caucus is a blind mob that possesses the ability to kill you upon first sight. However, if you sneak around the mob, you can avoid it. Following that is the second trigger point, where you receive your first power, which is a fireball. This is a projectile and you press space to use it. You are then greeted with your next mob, the Velox. The Velox is a projectile mob that may or may not shoot. It could be friendly and it could be deadly, depending on it’s mood. If you are greeted with an aggressive one, unless you use your fireballs, you will die. If you are greeted with a nice mob, you will be given a potion once it dies, so stay vigilant. Following that, you are given a power up, where you are given lighting. This is a close range weapon.

It’s important to note that as you go through this game, the weapons use mana. The more you go through the game, the more mana it’s worth. However, it is more deadly. Staying aware of the amount of hearts and the amount of mana you have is important because if you are left with none, you will die.

To pair with your newfound lighting abilities, you are also given a new mob, the Belliger. He is an aggressive, warlike mob that is slow but is a close-range fighter. He deals a lot of damage so choose your powers carefully. After defeating the Belliger, you get dark powers that you can utilize by pressing E. This is the strongest and takes half of your mana.

The room uses multiple “segments”, the first three are almost like an introduction, where you are taught what they do, and are and how to use your powers. After completing this tutorial like section, then you are on your own. You have two rooms that give you all your powers and you must defeat on your own. The last room being the hardest, after, you completed the game.

Pressing U, you will get all the potions.
